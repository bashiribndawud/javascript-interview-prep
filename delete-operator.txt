🗑️ delete Operator
The delete operator is used to remove a property from an object.

🔧 Example:
const user = {
  name: "Bashir",
  age: 25,
};

delete user.age;

console.log(user); // { name: "Bashir" }

❗ Notes:
It only works on object properties (not variables or functions).

Returns true if successful.

You cannot delete variables declared with let, const, or var.

🔍 typeof Operator
✅ What it does:
The typeof operator returns a string that tells you the type of a value.

console.log(typeof "hello");    // "string"
console.log(typeof 123);        // "number"
console.log(typeof true);       // "boolean"
console.log(typeof {});         // "object"
console.log(typeof undefined);  // "undefined"
console.log(typeof null);       // ❗ "object" (we'll explain below)

❗ Quirk:
typeof null === "object"; // true (this is a bug in JavaScript)
